For a dry run:

```bash
$ pan-os-upgrade --ip-address 192.168.1.1 --username admin --password secret --version 10.1.0 --dry-run
```

### CLI Arguments Description

When using command-line arguments, the following options are available:

| Argument       | Description                                                          | Required |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- |
| `--ip-address` | IP address of the target PAN-OS firewall.                            | Yes      |
| `--username`   | Username for authentication with the firewall.                       | Yes      |
| `--password`   | Password for authentication with the firewall.                       | Yes      |
| `--version`    | Target PAN-OS version to upgrade to.                                 | Yes      |
| `--dry-run`    | Perform a dry run of all tests and downloads without actual upgrade. | No       |
| `--log-level`  | Set the logging output level (e.g., debug, info, warning).           | No       |

Note: The use of an API key and `.env` file for configuration is no longer supported.

## Output and Assurance Functions

This output will include detailed logs of the process, such as establishing a connection, checking versions, performing upgrades, and rebooting the firewall.

## Assurance Functions

The script performs various assurance functions like readiness checks, snapshots, and configuration backups. These are stored in the `assurance/` directory, structured as follows:

- `snapshots/`: Contains pre and post-upgrade network state snapshots in JSON format.
- `readiness_checks/`: Holds results of readiness checks in JSON format.
- `configurations/`: Stores backups of the firewall's configuration in XML format.

### Log Files and Levels

Log entries are recorded in the `logs/` directory. The verbosity of logs can be controlled with the `--log-level` argument, with available options being `debug`, `info`, `warning`, `error`, and `critical`.

## Next Steps

With `pan-os-upgrade` configured, you're ready to execute the upgrade process. This guide should have provided you with all the necessary information to use the tool effectively within a Python environment.
