# Python Setup and Execution Guide for pan-os-upgrade

This guide provides comprehensive steps for configuring and executing the `pan-os-upgrade` package within a Python environment. It details command-line execution methods, including the new feature of targeting a Panorama appliance as a connection proxy.

## Configuring and Executing `pan-os-upgrade`

### Executing Without Command-Line Arguments

You can start the script interactively by simply issuing `pan-os-upgrade` from your current working directory. The interactive shell will prompt you to input the required arguments, including whether to target a standalone firewall or use Panorama as a proxy.

<div class="termy">

Welcome to the PAN-OS upgrade tool

This script software is provided on an 'as-is' basis with no warranties, and no support provided.

The selected `firewall` subcommand will upgrade a single Firewall appliance.

### Executing Using Command-Line Arguments

Alternatively, you can pass these details as command-line arguments. This method now includes an optional `--filter` argument for targeting devices managed by a Panorama appliance.

#### Direct Firewall Targeting

```bash
pan-os-upgrade firewall --hostname 192.168.255.1 --username admin --password secret --version 10.1.0
INFO - ✅ Connection to firewall established
... shortened output for brevity ...
```

#### Using Panorama as a Proxy

When the `batch` subcommand, your connections will be proxied through Panorama. In versions previous to `1.2.0`, you would have passed a regular expression to match the firewalls that you'd like to upgrade, but this workflow has been replaced with an interactive menu of firewalls connected to your Panorama appliance.

You can select devices by entering their numbers, ranges, or separated by commas.

Examples:

- 1
- 2-4
- 1,3,5-7

<div class="termy">

```console
❯ pan-os-upgrade batch
Panorama hostname or IP: panorama1.cdot.io
Panorama username: officehours

### CLI Arguments vs. CLI Options

In the context of the `pan-os-upgrade` application, it's important to distinguish between CLI arguments and CLI options:

- **CLI Arguments** are the primary commands that determine the operation mode of the application. They are not prefixed by `--` or `-` and are essential for defining the core action the script should perform.
- **CLI Options**, on the other hand, are additional modifiers or settings that further customize the behavior of the CLI arguments. They typically come with a `--` prefix (or `-` for shorthand) and are optional.

#### CLI Arguments

The following are the main commands (CLI arguments) for the `pan-os-upgrade` application, each tailored for specific upgrade scenarios:

| CLI Argument | Description                                                                                               |
| ------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `firewall`   | Targets an individual firewall for upgrade.                                                               |
| `panorama`   | Targets an individual Panorama appliance for upgrade.                                                     |
| `batch`      | Utilizes a Panorama appliance to orchestrate bulk upgrades of managed firewalls.                          |
| `inventory`  | Creates a `inventory.yaml` that will allow users to select the firewalls targeted for upgrade.            |
| `settings`   | Creates a `settings.yaml` that will allow users to customize the script's default settings and behaviors. |

#### CLI Options

Below are the CLI options that can be used in conjunction with the above CLI arguments to customize the upgrade process:

| CLI Option   | Shorthand | Description                                                                             |
| ------------ | --------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `--dry-run`  | `-d`      | Executes all preparatory steps without applying the actual upgrade, useful for testing. |
| `--hostname` | `-h`      | The IP address or DNS name of the target firewall or Panorama appliance.                |
| `--password` | `-p`      | The authentication password required for accessing the target device.                   |
| `--username` | `-u`      | The username for authentication with the target PAN-OS device.                          |
| `--version`  | `-v`      | Specifies the target PAN-OS version for the upgrade operation.                          |

Each CLI option has a specific role in tailoring the upgrade process, from defining the target device and authentication credentials to setting operational parameters like the target PAN-OS version and logging verbosity.

#### Option 1: Execute `pan-os-upgrade` without Command-Line Arguments

You can simply get started by issuing `pan-os-upgrade` from your current working directory, you will be guided to input the missing requirement arguments through an interactive shell.

##### Option 2: Execute `pan-os-upgrade` Using Command-Line Arguments

Alternatively, you can pass these details as command-line arguments when running the script.

> Note: You *can* pass your password as a CLI option with either `--password` or `-p`, but make sure you understand the risk of having your password in your terminal's history.

```bash
pan-os-upgrade firewall --hostname 192.168.1.1 --username admin --password secret --version 10.1.0
```

For a dry run:

```bash
pan-os-upgrade firewall --hostname 192.168.1.1 --username admin --password secret --version 10.1.0 --dry-run
```

## `inventory` Subcommand

The `inventory` subcommand introduces the capability to generate an `inventory.yaml` file, which lists the devices selected for upgrade. This file is generated based on the selections made through the interactive menu when targeting devices via a Panorama appliance.

<div class="termy">

```console
pan-os-upgrade inventory

</div>

This `inventory.yaml` file can then be used in subsequent upgrade commands to pre-define the target devices, streamlining the upgrade process. You can also directly edit this file with other firewall hostnames for future executions.

```yaml
firewalls_to_upgrade:
- lab-fw1
- lab-fw4
```

When the subcommand of `batch` is executed, it will look in the current working directory for a file named `inventory.yaml`, and if its found it will use the file's contents as a source of inventory, bypassing the firewall selection menu.

## Advanced Settings

If you would like to change the default settings of `pan-os-upgrade` tool, you can run the `settings` CLI argument. This will walk you through a series of options to change.

### Readiness Checks

| `session_stats`   | Snapshot of the Session Statistics  |         No         |

### Customizing Default Settings

The default settings for readiness checks and snapshots can be customized using the `pan-os-upgrade settings` subcommand. This interactive command guides you through a series of prompts to configure various aspects of the script's behavior, including which readiness checks and snapshots are enabled.

To override the default settings:

1. Run the `pan-os-upgrade settings` command.
2. Follow the prompts to enable or disable specific readiness checks and snapshots.
3. The resulting configurations are saved to a `settings.yaml` file in the current working directory.

#### Note

The `settings.yaml` file created by this command can be edited manually for further customization.

## Output and Assurance Functions

This output will include detailed logs of the process, such as establishing a connection, checking versions, performing upgrades, and rebooting the firewall or firewalls, especially when using Panorama as a proxy.

## Assurance Functions

The script performs various assurance functions like readiness checks, snapshots, and configuration backups. These are stored in the `assurance/` directory, structured as follows:

- `snapshots/`: Contains pre and post-upgrade network state snapshots in JSON format.
- `readiness_checks/`: Holds results of readiness checks in JSON format.
- `configurations/`: Stores backups of the firewall's configuration in XML format.

### Log Files and Levels

Log entries are recorded in the `logs/` directory. The verbosity of logs can be controlled by creating a `settings.yaml` file with `pan-os-upgrade settings` CLI command. Available options being `debug`, `info`, `warning`, `error`, and `critical`.

## Next Steps

With `pan-os-upgrade` configured, you're ready to execute the upgrade process. This guide should have provided you with all the necessary information to use the tool effectively within a Python environment. For further assistance or advanced tips, refer to the [Python Troubleshooting Guide](troubleshooting.md).
