<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Project Screenshot][product-screenshot]](https://paloaltonetworks.com)

This project is a comprehensive Python-based solution for automating PAN-OS upgrades. It's designed to provide network administrators and security professionals with an efficient tool to manage upgrades, configurations, and system checks of Palo Alto Networks appliances.

Key Features:

* Automates routine tasks, reducing manual errors and saving time.
* Customizable scripts to fit various network environments and requirements.
* Extensive interaction with Palo Alto Networks appliances for operations like readiness checks, state snapshots, and report generation.

### Built With

This project is built with the following technologies:

* [Python](https://python.org/)
* [pan-os-python SDK](https://github.com/PaloAltoNetworks/pan-os-python)
* [panos-upgrade-assurance](https://github.com/PaloAltoNetworks/pan-os-upgrade-assurance)
* [Pydantic](https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/)
* [defusedxml](https://pypi.org/project/defusedxml/)

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

To get started with the PAN-OS upgrade project, you need to set up your environment and install the necessary dependencies.

### Installation

Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/cdot65/pan-os-upgrade.git
cd pan-os-upgrade
```

Before running the script, ensure you have Python installed on your system. If you're new to Python, here's how you can set up a virtual environment, which allows us to install Python packages without having them conflict with our system's Python environment:

* Setting up a virtual environment

If you have Poetry on your machine, simply type `poetry install` and `poetry shell` to activate this project's virtual environment.

If Poetry is not installed, then you can build and activate the Python virtual enviornment manually.

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
```

```bash
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
```

Once the virutal environment has been created and activated, install the required packages

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to top</a>)</p>

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

This script provides a range of functionalities for interacting with PAN-OS devices. Below are some common use cases:

```bash
python upgrade.py --version 11.0.2-h1 --hostname 192.168.1.1 --username admin --password paloalto123 --log-level debug
```

### CLI Arguments Description

* `--api-key`: API Key for authentication
* `--hostname`: Hostname of the PAN-OS appliance.
* `--log-level`: Set the logging output level (e.g., debug, info, warning).
* `--password`: Password for authentication.
* `--username`: Username for authentication.
* `--version`: Target PAN-OS version to upgrade to.

### Define Variables Within .env

As an alternative to passing CLI arguments, which can be a security risk due to your console's history function, you can instead update the variables within the `.env` file of your project.

These environment variables will be used when CLI arguments are not provided, feel free to mix and match CLI arguments and hardcoded values within the .env file. Just note that if you're using an API key for authentication, leave the username and password blank.

```env
# PAN-OS credientials if using an API key, leave username and password blank
PAN_USERNAME=admin
PAN_PASSWORD=paloalto123
API_KEY=

# hostname or IP address
HOSTNAME=firewall1.example.com

# target PAN-OS version
TARGET_VERSION=11.0.2-h3

# manage the levels of logging of the script debug, info, warning, error, critical
LOG_LEVEL=debug
```

Then execute your script as follows:

```bash
python upgrade.py
```

<!-- TROUBLESHOOTING -->
## Troubleshooting

Encountered an issue? Here are some common problems and solutions:

* **Problem**: Script fails to connect to the PAN-OS device.
  * **Solution**: Check if the hostname and credentials are correct. Ensure network connectivity to the PAN-OS device.

* **Problem**: Error regarding missing dependencies.
  * **Solution**: Ensure all required packages are installed using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

* **Problem**: Script hangs during execution.
  * **Solution**: Check the firewall and network settings. Ensure the PAN-OS device is responding correctly.
